I am a psychologist and neuroimaging expert, faculty in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science and member of the Medical Discovery Team on Addiction. I received my PhD from Maastricht University in the Netherlands, where I developed fMRI-based neurofeedback training protocols for three different clinical populations. During my postdoctoral training at Mount Sinai, New York, I focused on the potential for personalized medical treatments in human drug addiction, investigating novel approaches for individualized treatments in cocaine addicted individuals.
My current work focuses on establishing the existence of neurobiological subtypes in different addicted human populations, with the goal of developing individualized brain-based and technology supported treatments for human drug addiction.

My research group combines the analysis of existing large-scale multimodal data sets with the acquisition of new data through a variety of techniques such as interviewing, neurocognitive testing, questionnaires and multi-modal neuroimaging. Novel computational methods are employed for linking social, demographic, neurocognitive, personality and clinical measures to the neuroimaging data, to explore the existence of neurobiological subtypes within the addicted population. The goal of this research is to develop neuroscience-derived individualized treatment for individuals who are at risk for either escalation of drug use or relapse.

Within the department, I am a member of the Grand Rounds Committee.
